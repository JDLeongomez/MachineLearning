# Instructions

## **Background**

Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how *much* of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

> This human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities dataset above). The approach we propose for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer. The "how (well)" investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.
>
> In this work ([see the paper](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201)) we first define quality of execution and investigate three aspects that pertain to qualitative activity recognition: the problem of specifying correct execution, the automatic and robust detection of execution mistakes, and how to provide feedback on the quality of execution to the user. We tried out an on-body sensing approach ([dataset here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/static/WLE/WearableComputing_weight_lifting_exercises_biceps_curl_variations.csv)), but also an "ambient sensing approach" (by using Microsoft Kinect - dataset still unavailable)
>
> Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).
>
> Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

## **Data**

The training data for this project are available here:

[[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv]{.ul}](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv)

The test data are available here:

<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv>

The data for this project come from this source: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har>. If you use the document you create for this class for any purpose please cite them as they have been very generous in allowing their data to be used for this kind of assignment [@vellosoQualitativeActivityRecognition2013].

## **What you should submit**

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the **"[classe]{.ul}"** variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did. You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

### Peer Review Portion

Your submission for the Peer Review portion should consist of a link to a Github repo with your R markdown and compiled HTML file describing your analysis. Please constrain the text of the writeup to \< 2000 words and the number of figures to be less than 5. It will make it easier for the graders if you submit a repo with a `gh-pages` branch so the HTML page can be viewed online (and you always want to make it easy on graders :-).

### Course Project Prediction Quiz Portion

Apply your machine learning algorithm to the 20 test cases available in the test data above and submit your predictions in appropriate format to the Course Project Prediction Quiz for automated grading.

## **Reproducibility**

Due to security concerns with the exchange of R code, your code will not be run during the evaluation by your classmates. Please be sure that if they download the repo, they will be able to view the compiled HTML version of your analysis.

# Preliminaries

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggfortify)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(dplyr)
```

## Load data

```{r load-data, cache=TRUE}
#Download and load datasets
training <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

#Set 'classe' as factor
training$classe <- as.factor(training$classe)
levels(training$classe)
```

Description of `classe` levels:

-   A = exactly according to the specification
-   B = throwing the elbows to the front
-   C = lifting the dumbbell only halfway
-   D = lowering the dumbbell only halfway
-   E = throwing the hips to the front

# Model

## Pre-process data

Columns 1 to 7 (i.e. columns: `r paste0(colnames(training)[1:7])`) are not likely to be good predictors. Because of this, I excluded them from the dataset.

```{r}
train <- training[,-c(1:7)]
```

There are several variables with a high number of `NAs` or `#DIV/0!`. These are obviously a problem for fitting the model, so I removed these from the dataset, using the `tidyverse` approach described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12454487/remove-columns-from-dataframe-where-some-of-values-are-na/12454779). 

```{r}
trainClean <- train %>%
   select_if(function(x) !(any(is.na(x)) | any(x == "")))
```

This leaves the database (`trainclean`) with `r dim(trainClean)[2]` columns.

Because there is a large number of variables, some may correlate strongly with each other. This is precisely the case. 

```{r}
#Create data frame only with numeric predictors
trainCleanCorr <- trainClean %>%
   select_if(function(x) is.numeric(x))
#Change variable names to numbers (to simplify plot)
colnames(trainCleanCorr) <- 1:length(colnames(trainCleanCorr))

#Correlation heatmap
ggcorrplot(cor(trainCleanCorr), 
           type = "upper",
           colors = c("blue","white","red"),
           ggtheme = ggpubr::theme_pubclean())  +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

## Further divide training dataset into training and testing sets 

To get both in and out of sample errors, I divided the training dataset (`trainClean`)

```{r}
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = trainClean$classe,
                               p = 0.7,
                               list = FALSE)
trainTrain <- trainClean[inTrain,]
trainTest <- trainClean[-inTrain,]
```

## Model

```{r model, cache=TRUE}
#Specify trControl options with cross validation ("cv")
set.seed(123)

library(doParallel)
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(5)
registerDoParallel(cl)

start.time <- proc.time()
m <- train(classe ~.,
           data = trainTrain,
           preProc=c("center", "scale"),
           method = "rf",
           #prox = TRUE,
           trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5))
stop.time <- proc.time()
run.time <- stop.time - start.time

stopCluster(cl)

m
```

Fitting the model took `r print(run.time[3])` seconds. 

(667.22 without prox = TRUE)

### Variable importance

```{r fig.height=8}
imp.df <- varImp(m)$importance

ggplot(imp.df, aes(x = reorder(row.names.data.frame(imp.df), Overall),
                   y = Overall,
                   fill = Overall)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Variable Importance") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Information Value Summary") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="blue", high="red") +
  theme_pubclean() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

### Error

#### In and out of sample error

```{r}
trError <- confusionMatrix(trainTrain$classe,
                           predict(m, trainTrain))
tsError <- confusionMatrix(trainTest$classe,
                           predict(m, trainTest))

kable(cbind(trError$table, tsError$table),
      booktabs = TRUE,
      align = "c",
      caption = "In and out of sample error") %>%
        kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
        add_header_above(c(" " = 1, 
                           "In sample error" = 5, 
                           "Out of sample error" = 5))
```
