> ## **Background**
>
> Using devices such as *Jawbone Up*, *Nike FuelBand*, and *Fitbit* it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how *much* of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: <http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har> (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

> > This human activity recognition research has traditionally focused on discriminating between different activities, i.e. to predict "which" activity was performed at a specific point in time (like with the Daily Living Activities dataset above). The approach we propose for the Weight Lifting Exercises dataset is to investigate "how (well)" an activity was performed by the wearer. The "how (well)" investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.

We tried out an on-body sensing approach ([dataset here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/static/WLE/WearableComputing_weight_lifting_exercises_biceps_curl_variations.csv)), but also an "ambient sensing approach" (by using Microsoft Kinect - dataset still unavailable)

> >

Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate. The exercises were performed by six male participants aged between 20-28 years, with little weight lifting experience. We made sure that all participants could easily simulate the mistakes in a safe and controlled manner by using a relatively light dumbbell (1.25kg).

# Summary {.unnumbered}

In this report, I attempt predict the manner in which a group of participants exercise, using machine learning algorithms. These data are described [here](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) [@vellosoQualitativeActivityRecognition2013]. This class (variable `classe`) is categorised in 5 levels:

-   A = exactly according to the specification
-   B = throwing the elbows to the front
-   C = lifting the dumbbell only halfway
-   D = lowering the dumbbell only halfway
-   E = throwing the hips to the front

To do this, I have a training dataset containing all variables (*n* = 19622), and a testing dataset (*n* = 20) that only contains the predictors, but not the dependent variable (i.e. `classe`). To predict the class, I then divided the original training dataset into further training (`trainTrain`: 70% of the cases; *n* = 13737) and testing (`trainTest`: 30% of the cases; *n* = 5885) datasets, to test the out of sample error with the latter.

I decided to use random forests, as this technique is robust and generally performs well [e.g. @statnikovComprehensiveComparisonRandom2008]. Because all predictors are quantitative, I trained two models, one with PCA pre-processing (Model 1) to create features, and one only with centring and scaling of the predictor variables (Model 2).

Both models have an extremely high accuracy (see section \@ref(accuracy)). Unsurprisingly, however, Model 2 performs slightly better, despite being more computationally demanding given its larger number of variables, and despite strong correlations between some predictors. Therefore, Model 2 is used to predict `classe` in the original testing (*n* = 20) dataset.

# Preliminaries

## Load packages

Load all used packages.

```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
library(ggfortify)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(randomForest)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(caret)
library(dplyr)
library(doParallel) #for parallel computation
```

## Load data

Download and load the original training and testing datasets.

```{r load-data, cache=TRUE}
#Download and load datasets
training <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

#Set 'classe' as factor
training$classe <- as.factor(training$classe)
#levels(training$classe)
```

# Models

## Pre-process data

Columns 1 to 7 (i.e. columns: `r paste0(colnames(training)[1:7])`) are not likely to be good predictors. Because of this, I excluded them from the dataset.

```{r}
train <- training[,-c(1:7)]
```

There are several variables with a high number of `NAs` or `#DIV/0!`. These are obviously a problem for fitting the model, so I removed these from the dataset, using the `tidyverse` approach described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12454487/remove-columns-from-dataframe-where-some-of-values-are-na/12454779).

```{r}
trainClean <- train %>%
   select_if(function(x) !(any(is.na(x)) | any(x == "")))
```

This leaves the database (`trainclean`) with `r dim(trainClean)[2]` columns.

Because there is a large number of variables, some may correlate strongly with each other. This is the case.

```{r corrplot, fig.cap = "Correlation matrix heatmap."}
#Create data frame only with numeric predictors
trainCleanCorr <- trainClean %>%
   select_if(function(x) is.numeric(x))
#Change variable names to numbers (to simplify plot)
colnames(trainCleanCorr) <- 1:length(colnames(trainCleanCorr))

#Correlation heatmap
ggcorrplot(cor(trainCleanCorr), 
           type = "upper",
           colors = c("blue","white","red"),
           ggtheme = ggpubr::theme_pubclean())  +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

## Further divide *clean* training dataset into training and testing sets

To be able to calculate both in and out of sample errors, I divided the training dataset (`trainClean`) into further training (`trainTrain`; 70% of the cases) and testing (`trainTest`; 30% of the cases) datasets.

```{r}
#seed
set.seed(17)
#Data partition
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = trainClean$classe,
                               p = 0.7,
                               list = FALSE)
trainTrain <- trainClean[inTrain,]
trainTest <- trainClean[-inTrain,]
```

## Training Models

### Model 1: with PCA pre-processing

Because some predictor variables correlate strongly (see Fig. \@ref(fig:corrplot)), I attempted a model with PCA pre-processing (which has 24 PCs).

```{r model1, cache = TRUE}
#seed
set.seed(17)

#Start parallel processing
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(5)
registerDoParallel(cl)

#Specify trainControl options with cross validation ("cv")
start.time <- proc.time()
m1 <- train(classe ~.,
           data = trainTrain,
           preProc = "pca",
           method = "rf",
           trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5))
stop.time <- proc.time()
run.time <- stop.time - start.time

#End parallel processing
stopCluster(cl)
```

#### Model 1 summary

```{r}
m1
```

### Model 2: with simple centre and scaling pre-processing

In addition, and for comparison, I fitted an equivalent model, but with simple centre and scaling pre-processing, instead of PCA.

```{r model2, cache = TRUE}
#seed
set.seed(17)

#Start parallel processing
cl <- makePSOCKcluster(5)
registerDoParallel(cl)

#Specify trainControl options with cross validation ("cv")
start.time2 <- proc.time()
m2 <- train(classe ~.,
           data = trainTrain,
           preProc = c("center", "scale"),
           method = "rf",
           trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", 5))
stop.time2 <- proc.time()
run.time2 <- stop.time2 - start.time2

#End parallel processing
stopCluster(cl)
```

#### Model 2 summary

```{r}
m2
```

### Variable importance

Variable importance is reported in Fig. \@ref(fig:importance), for both models.

```{r  importance, fig.cap = "Variable importance for both models. (A) Model 1 (PCA pre-processing). (B) Model 2 (centring and scaling pre-processing).", fig.height = 8}
imp.m1 <- varImp(m1)$importance
imp.m2 <- varImp(m2)$importance

p1 <- ggplot(imp.m1, aes(x = reorder(row.names.data.frame(imp.m1), Overall),
                         y = Overall,
                         fill = Overall)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Variable Importance") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Model 1") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="blue", high="red") +
  theme_pubclean() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

p2 <- ggplot(imp.m2, aes(x = reorder(row.names.data.frame(imp.m2), Overall),
                         y = Overall,
                         fill = Overall)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", position="dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Variable Importance") +
  xlab("") +
  ggtitle("Model 2") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="blue", high="red") +
  theme_pubclean() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")

ggarrange(p1, p2,
          ncol = 2,
          widths = c(1,1.3),
          common.legend = TRUE,
          labels = "AUTO",
          legend = "right")
```

### Comparison of the two models

To compare the two models, I used a confusion matrix for each model, both in and out of sample, as well as accuracy.

#### Confusion matrix

Figure \@ref(fig:confmats) shows the number of predicted cases in each category (`classe`) against the true categories. This illustrates how, while both Model 1 and Model 2 are perfectly accurate in the training (`trainTrain`) sample, as shown by the in sample confusion matrices (Fig. \@ref(fig:confmats)A, C), Model 2 is more accurate in the testing (`trainTest`) sample (Fig. \@ref(fig:confmats)D) than Model 1 (Fig. \@ref(fig:confmats)B).

```{r confmats, fig.cap = "Confusion matrix for training and testing samples. This Figure shows the number of predicted cases in each category (classe) against the true categories, for both models (top row: Model 1; bottom row: Model 2), and both in (left pannels) and out of sample (right pannels). (A) Model 1, in sample. (B) Model 1, out of sample. (C) Model 2, in sample. (D) Model 2, out of sample.", fig.height=8}

                              predict(m1, trainTrain))
#Out of sample confusion matrix model 1
tsError.m1 <- confusionMatrix(trainTest$classe,
                              predict(m1, trainTest))
#In sample confusion matrix model 2
trError.m2 <- confusionMatrix(trainTrain$classe,
                              predict(m2, trainTrain))
#Out of sample confusion matrix model 2
tsError.m2 <- confusionMatrix(trainTest$classe,
                              predict(m2, trainTest))

          common.legend = TRUE,
          labels = "AUTO",
          legend = "right")
```

#### Accuracy

To further illustrate the difference in accuracy between the two models, and make a final decision of which model to select, I compared the accuracy of the two models.

```{r errors}
t1 <- cbind(data.frame(trError.m1$overall), 
            data.frame(trError.m2$overall),
            data.frame(tsError.m1$overall), 
            data.frame(tsError.m2$overall))
row.names(t1) <- c("Accuracy",
                   "Kappa",
                   "Lower 95% CI",
                   "Upper  95% CI",
                   "AccuracyNull",
                   "*p*",
                   "McnemarPValue")
t1 <- t1[c(1,3,4,2,6),]

kable(t1,
      booktabs = TRUE,
      digits = 4,
      col.names = rep(c("Model 1", "Model 2"), times = 2),
      caption = "Accuracy, kappa statistic and significance of Models 1 and 2, both in and out of sample") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1,
                     "In sample" = 2,
                     "Out of sample" = 2))
  
```

This shows that while the in sample accuracy was the same for both models (both classified correctly all cases), the out of sample accuracy was better in Model 2 (Accuracy = `r round(t1$tsError.m2.overall[1], 3)`, 95% CI[`r paste0(round(t1$tsError.m2.overall[2], 3), " - ", round(t1$tsError.m2.overall[3], 3))`], kappa = `r round(t1$tsError.m2.overall[4], 3)`, *p* \< 0.0001) than in Model 1 (Accuracy = `r round(t1$tsError.m1.overall[1], 3)`, 95% CI[`r paste0(round(t1$tsError.m1.overall[2], 3), " - ", round(t1$tsError.m1.overall[3], 3))`], kappa = `r round(t1$tsError.m1.overall[4], 3)`, *p* \< 0.0001).

## Course Project Prediction Quiz

Model 2 was the most accurate. Based on this model, I predicted the `classe` for each case on the original testing dataset, to be submitted for automatic grading.

```{r}
predict(m2, testing)
```
